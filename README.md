Home Automation Project based on Raspberry Pi + Arduinos;
===========

This project uses 2(or more) arduinos to talk with other systems via wireless RF.

The 2 arduinos execute the same sketch, so you can send data over wireless multithreaded to the quantity of arduinos you plug(usb) on your Raspberry Pi.

I will publish the arduino sketch Im using in the future. Im just cleaning it up :P
